# CourseraGetAndCleanDataProject

This repo is for the Project work of the Coursera course: Getting and Cleaning Data.

The script run_analysis.R will do the followings:

1) Download the required data into the local folder ./data
2) Merge the training and testing data
3) Filter out the mean and std field of the main data file
4) Do the averaging of the dataset in step 3 per column
5) Reformat the working file and save it locally as DataSetAvg.txt
